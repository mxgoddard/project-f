Carousel images: 1920x600
2400x2400
Clicking on carousel throws error, doesn't automatically cycle because children of the carousel have not been initialized yet

External Research:

"Loading in huge, oversized images that we scale down using width and height HTML attributes when we want more space for text content on smaller browsing devices is not a
good practice for faster web page load times."
Load in images at the maximum required size and nothing more.

xxx this isn't related directly to your problem, but it will massively affect your conversion rate: the site has a real issue with speed.
On mobile (where most of your customers are I imagine) it took over 30 seconds to get to a useable point. Google found that over 50% of users leave a site if it takes more than 3 seconds and
the BBC found for every added second it lost 10% of users.
I'm surprised you are getting any sales at all tbh. It is crazy heavy. Take a look at this for more info: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fproperfitness.co%2F
